The name was taken from a Portuguese Joe song entitled \"Teenage Riot\" from the album ''Teen-age Riot'', with the word 'Atari' added as an [[Atari ST]] computer was used to create compositions. Highly political, they fused [[anarchist]], [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and anti-Nazi views with [[punk rock|punk]] vocals and the newly emerging techno sound called [[digital hardcore]], which is a term band member [[Alec Empire]] used as the name of [[Digital Hardcore Recordings|his record label]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| page= 35\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe group was founded as an attack on the [[Neo-Nazi]] subculture by fusing hardcore punk views with German techno; it consisted of three [[Berlin]]ers&mdash;[[Alec Empire]], [[Hanin Elias]] and [[Rapping|MC]] [[Carl Crack]]. ATR's early releases (which included the track \"Hetzjagd Auf Nazis!\"/\"Hunt Down the Nazis!\") were surrounded by controversy in Germany.\n\nAfter signing to major European label [[Phonogram Records]] in 1993, the band received a large financial advance<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Sean |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/atari-teenage-riot-mn0000608746 |title=Atari Teenage Riot - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=6 September 2001 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> which they duplicitously used to set up their own [[record label]]: [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]] (DHR). ATR never delivered a commercially viable demo to Phonogram.<ref name=\"atronion\">{{cite web|last=Hansen |first=Todd |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23323 |title=Atari Teenage Riot &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

ATR's record label [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]] released the debut album \"Delete Yourself!\" internationally. In 1996 the [[Beastie Boys]] licensed the album and released it in the US with extra songs under the title \"Burn Berlin Burn\" on their label [[Grand Royal]].\n\nThe band toured with [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Rage Against The Machine]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Moby]] and [[Beck]].\n\nIn 1996, ATR was joined by [[Nic Endo]], a [[Japan]]ese-[[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] noise/soundscape artist, who played her first live show with ATR in the spring of 1997 during the South by South West festival in Austin, Texas.<ref name=Tumblr>{{cite web|url=http://riotnews.tumblr.com/ |title=riot-news |publisher=Riotnews.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, ATR released the album ''60 Second Wipe Out'', which featured a number of guest artists, including New York City rappers [[Arsonists (rap group)|The Arsonists]]. According to ''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]'', \"Empire's guitar-playing values speed-thrash malevolence, and when paired with Endo's painful skronkage, the album is decidedly denser than its predecessor\".\n\nElias left ATR at the Brixton Academy show in the winter of 1999. The plan had been to tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]] in the US during the spring of 2000, but ATR decided to cancel the show to recharge. Crack also needed time to recuperate from his psychosis attacks.<ref name=Tumblr/>\n\nIn the autumn of 2000, ATR started working on their fourth album. The song \"Rage\", featuring Tom Morello from [[Rage Against The Machine]], was chosen as an in-between single until the release of the fourth album. Rage was part of the recording sessions for ''60 Second Wipe Out'', but Empire didn’t feel it would fit the album.<ref name=Tumblr/>\n\nOn 6 September 2001, Crack, who had long struggled with psychiatric issues, died from an overdose of unspecified pills.<ref name=\"crackmtv\">Corey Moss, [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449099/20010924/atari_teenage_riot.jhtml Atari Teenage Riot Cofounder Dead At 30], [[MTV]], 24 September 2001, retrieved 13 March 2007.</ref> The media hype surrounding Crack's death is disputed by ATR. According to a friend, he had spoken a few weeks before his death about a doctor's report which said his psychosis attacks would worsen with age. According to that friend, Crack said he would rather kill himself than become a \"zombie\" and not be in control of his life. Witnesses have said Crack tried to reach out to his friends because he felt the psychosis starting again. When his body was found by police with large quantities of medication in his stomach, this suggested suicide. It is still unclear if this happened while he was in a state of psychosis or not (while in a psychotic state, it could be interpreted as an accident rather than suicide).<ref name=Tumblr/>\n\nThe other half of the band continue to work together. Endo assisted in the production of Empire's solo recordings, as well as being a key member of his live band. DHR released ''[[Atari Teenage Riot: 1992-2000]]'', a collection of the band's best known recordings, on 3 July 2006.\n\n==Reformation==\n[[File:W0768-Hellfest2013 AtariTeenageRiot 72287.JPG|thumb|A.T.R., {{fr icon}} [[:fr:Hellfest#Édition 2013|Hellfest 2013]].]]\nIn October 2009, Elias contacted Empire to play some concerts together, but had to refrain because of her voice.<ref>[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/pop/fuer-immer-stoerenfried/1920476.html Interview with Alec Empire in the German newspaper \"Der Tagesspiegel\" on 7 September 2010]</ref>  When it became clear that Elias wouldn’t show up to the first show, the band published a statement 30 minutes before show time.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://riotnews.tumblr.com/post/4978040387/riot-news-com-may-2010 |title=riot-news |publisher=Riotnews.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2010, it was announced ATR would reunite for a few live shows in Europe.<ref name=\"gigwise.com\"/> Later in the year, they announced additional shows in Europe, North America and Asia. In early March 2010, Empire released the new ATR track \"Activate\" via [[SoundCloud]], which is the first song featuring their new MC, CX KiDTRONiK. Activate was recorded on 3 March 2010 in Berlin at the Hellish Vortex Studios. Female vocals were provided by Endo.\n\nThe band played most major festivals throughout Europe in 2010, including Reading and Leeds, and headlined the Fusion Festival in front of approximately 20,000 people (which led to a massive stage invasion by thousands of fans). In the same year, ATR headlined a stage at Japan's Summersonic Festival, returning the following year to play at Fuji Rock Festival.<ref name=\"timeouttokyo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/5216/Atari-Teenage-Riot-the-interview |title=Atari Teenage Riot: The Interview |accessdate=28 September 2012 |last=Hadfield |first=James |coauthors= |date=12 November 2011 |work=Time Out Tokyo |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522115105/http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/5216/Atari-Teenage-Riot-the-interview |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Another triumph was the band's headline slot on the electronic stage at the Berlin Festival, which is held at an old military airport in the centre of the city.

The live line-up of ATR, {{As of|2011|06|lc=yes}}, consisted of Empire, Endo and CX KiDTRONiK.\n\nOn 12 October 2010, [[Steve Aoki]] and [[Dim Mak Records]] announced the release of Atari Teenage Riot's new single \"Activate\", with the full-length album ''[[Is This Hyperreal?]]'' released in 2011. While the record was described as \"redundant\" by [[Pitchfork Media]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15610-is-this-hyperreal/ |title= Is This Hyperreal? |accessdate= 28 September 2012 |last=Breihan |first=Tom |coauthors= |date= 7 July 2011 |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] |publisher= }}</ref> in what Empire called \"probably one of the dumbest reviews I’ve ever read about any record.\",<ref name=\"timeouttokyo\" /> other magazines gave it great reviews. [[New Musical Express]] wrote:\"“Few bands have ever detonated as powerfully in the underground as Atari Teenage Riot. Put simply, they were the conscience of electronic music. They were a band that sounded the way you always wanted [[The Prodigy]] to sound. A band akin to Black Flag if that outfit had existed in an age where every home had a computer. And their influence burned big and bright.” [[Artrocker]]  Magazine put them on the cover in their May 2011 issue and wrote:\"“Make no mistake, ‘Activate’ is the most exhilarating, futuristic and punk rock single of the month. (...) ATR aren’t like any other band. They’re the only group that could have cut a record with Rage Against The Machine and have it be their meekest recording. They’re the only group that iTunes have censored on the grounds that their music could create riots! Ten years and several line-up changes makes no difference to tonight's immediate onslaught of rave, punk, screaming and pounding gabba. The finale consists of the fiercest white noise squall of the evening, and the audience's reaction (moshing, screaming, crowdsurfing, shoes flying through the air) seems to indicate they don’t care either.”{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nTheir album ''Is This Hyperreal?'' was celebrated as \"the ultimate protest album of the google age,\" dealing with WikiLeaks, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], hackers, the freedom the internet brought to the suppressed, censorship, the surveillance state, cyber terrorism and digital decay, a term which describes the disaffected masses abandoning the internet when they realized that it was not free but infested with government controls.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The campaign for ''Is This Hyperreal?'' took an interesting turn when the Black Flags viral video was taken up by Anonymous whose members and supporters sent in clips from the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests last autumn. Remixes, mash ups and alternate versions created by fans to represent their own dissatisfaction proliferated and captured the mood so accurately it was played in a [[CNN]] broadcast to summarise the zeitgeist behind Anonymous' cyber attacks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In December ATR got the news that [[WikiLeaks]] could provide exclusive footage from [[Julian Assange]] speaking at Occupy London. [[Boing Boing]] blog and [[Dangerous Minds]] were calling it the first anthem of the Occupy movement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Dangerous Minds: \"While personally I would have thought it would be a new act to break through representing a new generation, no-one can doubt ATR’s credentials when it comes to this kind of thing. In fact, maybe in this age of ultra-commodified music it would HAVE to take a more veteran, established act to represent OWS and Anonymous so as to avoid claims of false appropriation? You have to hand it to ATR though; “Black Flags” is a pretty great tune. I’d say it's one of their most accessible yet while retaining all that dark techno-punk scuzzy energy we know and love.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn Spring 2012 the music video for \"Black Flags\" was nominated for the [[MTV]] O Music Awards in the US in the category \"Best Protest Song Of The Year\".\n\n==Discography==<!-- This section is linked from [[Hanin Elias]] -->\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Delete Yourself!]]'' (originally titled ''1995'') (DHR 1995)\n* ''[[The Future of War]]'' (DHR 1997)\n* ''[[60 Second Wipe Out]]'' (DHR 1999)\n* ''[[Is This Hyperreal?]]'' (DHR 2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyho-blog.com/2011/03/21/atari-teenage-riot-make-strong-statement-about-human-trafficking-with-%e2%80%98blood-in-my-eyes%e2%80%99/ |title=Atari Teenage Riot Make Strong Statement About Human Trafficking With ‘Blood In My Eyes’ |publisher=Eyho-blog.com |date= |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n* ''[[Reset (Atari Teenage Riot album)|Reset]]'' (DHR 2014)\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* ''[[Burn, Berlin, Burn!]]'' (Grand Royal 1997)\n* ''[[Redefine the Enemy - Rarities and B-Side Compilation 1992-1999]]'' (DHR 2002)\n* ''[[Atari Teenage Riot: 1992–2000]]'' (DHR 2006)\n* ''Unreleased Tracks 1991-1994''\n\n===Live albums===\n* ''[[Live in Stuttgart (One-Off Shit Let's Go!)]]'' (DHR 1996)\n* ''[[Live in Philadelphia Dec. 1997]]'' (DHR 1998)\n* ''[[Live at Brixton Academy (Atari Teenage Riot album)|Live at Brixton Academy]]'' (DHR 1999)\n* Riot in Japan 2011 (DHR 2011)\n\n===Video===\n* ''Sixteen Years of Video Material'' (with Alec Empire) (Monitorpop 2008)\n\n===Singles/EPs===\n* \"[[ATR (Atari Teenage Riot song)|ATR]]\" (\"Atari Teenage Riot\") (Phonogram 1993)\n* \"[[Kids Are United E.P.]]\" (Phonogram 1993)\n* \"Raver Bashing\" ([[Split EP|split]] with \"Together for Never\" by Alec Empire) (Riot Beats 1994)\n* \"[[Speed/Midijunkies]]\" (DHR 1996)\n* \"Deutschland Has Gotta Die!\" (Grand Royal 1996)\n* \"[[Not Your Business E.P.]]\" (Grand Royal 1996)\n* \"[[Destroy 2000 Years of Culture]]\" (Intercord 1997)\n* \"Paranoid\" (split with \"Free Satpal Ram\" by [[Asian Dub Foundation]]) ([[Damaged Goods (record label)|Damaged Goods]] 1997)\n* \"[[Sick to Death]]\" (DHR 1997)\n* \"[[Atari Teenage Riot II]]\" (DHR 1999)\n* \"[[Revolution Action E.P.]]\" (DHR 1999)\n* \"[[Too Dead for Me EP]]\" (DHR 1999)\n* \"[[Rage E.P.]]\" (DHR 2000)\n* \"Activate\" (DHR 2010)<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n* \"Blood in My Eyes\" (DHR 2011)\n* \"Black Flags\" (DHR 2011)\n* \"Collapse of History Remixes\" (DHR 2012)\n* \"Collapse of History\" (DHR 2012)\n\n===Other recordings===\n* \"Sex Law Penetration\" on ''[[Orgazmo]] (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' (Nickelbag 1998)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.atari-teenage-riot.com Atari Teenage Riot] official site\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1999/Mar19atariteenageriot/ ATR's John Peel Session 1999] at [[BBC Radio 1]]\n\n{{Atari Teenage Riot}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:German electronic music groups]]\n[[Category:German techno music groups]]\n[[Category:Hardcore techno music groups]]\n[[Category:German industrial music groups]]\n[[Category:German punk rock groups]]\n[[Category:Hip house music groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2000]]\n[[Category:Digital hardcore music groups]]\n[[Category:German thrash metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Political music]]"}]}]}}

Their music has a mixed style which includes [[punk rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[electronica]], [[techno]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[breakbeat hardcore]]. Their group name is derived from an [[Ayn Rand]] quote found in the book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.\n\n==History==\nBetween 1987 and 1996, James Euringer (stage name Jimmy Urine) recorded about 35 songs which varied in musical style, usually settling in an industrial/electronic punk style. These songs were recorded alone by Euringer in New York City using rudimentary equipment. Euringer released an album titled ''Mindless Self-Indulgence'', which featured songs in a very industrial style akin to [[Nine Inch Nails]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe first concert using the name \"Mindless Self Indulgence\" was performed on September 7, 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 1997, Euringer recorded a cover of Method Man's \"Bring The Pain\", which was made by merging six different styles of the same cover into one song. This became the basis for the Mindless Self Indulgence sound. Shortly after, the current band was formed when Jimmy Urine was joined by Steve, Righ? on guitar, Urine's brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist Lyn-Z), and Urine's cousin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elftown.com/_Mindless%20Facts |title=Mindless Facts |publisher=Elftown.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Kitty on drums. They have released five albums, two EPs, one live album, and one live DVD. Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.\n\nIn January 2009, the band headlined the [[Kerrang!]] Relentless Energy Drink tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1302301/kerrang-tour-returns-in-2009 |title=Kerrang!
